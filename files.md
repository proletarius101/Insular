File Shuttle - Bridge for cross-border file access
====================================================

Insular provides a special documents provider of Android Storage Access Framework for cross-border file access.
Currently it enables apps (supporting Android SAF) in Insular to access files in mainland.
The reverse direction file access will be implemented in future version.
